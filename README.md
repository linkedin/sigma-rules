Community Sigma rules authored by LinkedIn's SEEK team for threat detection and threat hunting

## Background
SEEK encompasses LinkedInâ€™s detection, response, and supporting infrastructure teams. Our mission is to protect all corporate assets from damage, theft, exposure, and abuse.

We support a large and diverse technology ecosystem that spans all major operating systems, multiple cloud providers, SaaS applications, and numerous internally-developed applications and platforms.

This repository contains a curated set of Sigma rules authored by SEEK and partner security teams. We hope these rules benefit the community by enhancing threat detection capabilities and fostering collaboration in securing diverse technology ecosystems.

## Organization
The structure of this repo roughly follows that of [SigmaHQ](https://github.com/SigmaHQ/sigma/) and is organized by `logsource` (product, category, and service). We strive to follow Sigma's [conventions](https://github.com/SigmaHQ/sigma-specification/tree/main/sigmahq) and best practices for all published rules.
